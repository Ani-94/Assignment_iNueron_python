    "Answer:\n",
    "re.compile()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why do raw strings often appear in Regex objects?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "To avoid ambiguity in the code where a backlash has to be followed by an another \n",
    "backlash to escape, which would give rise to series of backlashes which will be very ambiguous. \n",
    "\n",

    "7. The findall() method returns a string list or a list of string tuples. What causes it to return one of the two options?\n",

    "\\S = Any non space\n",
    "\n",

    "or Carol; the second word is either eats, pets, or throws; the third word is apples, cats, or baseballs; \n",
    "and the sentence ends with a period? This regex should be case-insensitive. It must match the following:\n",
