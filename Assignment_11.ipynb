    "2. Write an assert statement that triggers an AssertionError if the variables eggs and bacon contain strings that are the same as each other, even if their cases are different (that is, 'hello' and 'hello' are considered the same, and 'goodbye' and 'GOODbye' are also considered the same).\n",

    "Answer:\n",
    "Step Over: On execution of function during debugging the code will executed and the result will captured but no debugging will happen\n",
    "Step In: On execution of function during debugging the code will executed and  debugging of the function will happen the result will captured\n",
    "Step Out: If the execution is paused then by clicking step out the rest of the function will be executed\n",
