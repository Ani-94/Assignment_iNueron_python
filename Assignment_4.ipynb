    "1. What exactly is []?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "[] signifies an empty list to which elements can be added\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "By using the function insert() hello can be replaced with the 3rd element in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "'d'\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the value of spam[-1]?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "‘d’\n",

    "Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    "7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?\n",
    " [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?\n",
    " [3.14, 'cat,' 11, True, 99]\n",
    "\n",
    "9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "list concatenation adds the new list at the end of an another list\n",
    "list replication duplicates the list by n number times in to an another new list\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Append(): updates the list by adding the query/s as a single element at the end of the list\n",
    "insert(): replaces an element of the list with desired element. Or the input element a a specified index will replace the element at that index\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "remove() : to remove specified element in the list\n",
    "pop(): to remove element at a specified index\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "Both list and string are sequences that is a character in a string or an element in a list can be called by mentioning their index number\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "List are mutable, have a lot of methods to manipulate it and lists are more suitable in modification related operation like inserting elements or removing themselves\n",
    "While tuples are immutable, dont have a lot of methods but best suitable for accessing elements from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "t= (42,)\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "For list value’s tuple form we use zip and iter functions as shown:\n",
    "[x for x in zip(*iter[(list)])]\n",
    "For tuple value’s list form we use zip func as shown:\n",
    "list(zip(list1,list2,list3,’’’)\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Variables that \"contain\" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "They contain references or memory location of the elements\n",
    "\n",
    "17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "copy.copy(): just copies the reference of the original object thus the original data will be\n",
    "             affected if the copied data is manipulated since only the reference is copied but the object remains the same, so changing the properties of copied object will effect the properties of original object\n",
    "copy.deepcopy(): copies the content to new reference thus the original data will not be \n",
    "             affected if the copied data is manipulated"
